<div class= "item4">There are a number of ways to support social justice in recycling, one being zero waste. Zero waste is the concept of making less trash. “We aim to send nothing to a landfill. We reduce what we need, reuse as much as we can, send little to be recycled, and compost what we cannot.”-<a href= "https://www.goingzerowaste.com/zero-waste-1.">About Zero Waste</a>. 
The saying goes,  ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’, and instead of going straight to recycling, people are trying the first two of the three. They are trying to reduce how much trash they’re making, and reuse anything they can. An example of this would be using a handkerchief instead of a bunch of tissues. With simple changes like these, we’ll be able to reduce unnecessary trash.
